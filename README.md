### Pitch Perfect

**Pitch Perfect** is an application that lets you record your voice and then play it back with various effects:

* Chipmunk voice
* Darth Vader voice
* Reverb
* Play it faster
* Play it slower

The recording can be paused and resumed.

It showcases how to use the AVFondation: AVAudioEngine, AVAudioPlayer, AVAudioFile, etc. It also shows basic segue and some UIKit methods.
